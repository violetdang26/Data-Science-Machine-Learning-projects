The dataset refers to numeric data obtained from the scanning of handwritten digits from envelopes by the U.S. Postal Service. The original scanned digits are binary and of different sizes and orientations; the images here have been deslanted and size normalized, resulting in 16 x 16 grayscale images

Here, I use different approach to analyze this dataset, including but not limited to:
- Principal Component Analysis
- Linear Discriminant Analysis
- Support Vector Machine (Linear and RBF Kernel)
- AdaBoost (implemented from scratch)
- Convolutional Neural Network with Keras
