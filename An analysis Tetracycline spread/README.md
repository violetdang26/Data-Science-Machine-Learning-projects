Ideas which we take today as common such as `viral marketing' and `early adopters' grew from sociological studies on the diffusion of information.  One of the most famous such studies tracked how a then-new antibiotic, tetracycline, spread among doctors in four small cities in Illinois in the 1950s.  Here I will study this data and study the idea that the innovation (in this case tetracycline) `spread' from one person to the next using different analysis techniques.
