The dataset contains traffic complaints in the city of Boston. Our goal is to utitilize different natural language processing methods to predict if the complaints are correctly classified, and to come up with a better categorization of the complaints (topic modeling). 

NLP methods used:
- ngram
- tf-idf
- bag of words
- Topic Modeling:
    - Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
    - Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)

Conclusion:
- We were able to create 10 new topics to better classifies the comments. The F1 Score increased to 90% from 77% with the existing categories using Character N-grams.
